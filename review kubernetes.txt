what is kubernetes?
- container orchestration tool which controls and manages every container and actions performed on and inside it .
- schedules containers for high availability 	
-eg maestro 
#features:
- service discovery and load balancing
- horizontal scaling
- self healing with user definedd healt checks
- automated rollout and rollback
- secrets and configuration management
- operators

what is container?
(segregated user-space env for running applications isolated from other applications sharing same os)
- set of processes isolated from hardware 
- a bundle of packages of libraries and dependencies required to run a particular application
- it consist of a base image which has minimum os to run the packages .
- image has required configuration.
- vroom,
#features: 
1. namespace - isolates resources.

2. controlgroups- limit amount of resources container can consume.

3. secomp - limits how processes could use system calls 
-  It provides a way to restrict the system calls that containerized applications can make, reducing their attack surface and minimizing the potential for security vulnerabilities
- a. System Call Filtering: Seccomp allows you to create policies that specify which system calls are permitted and which are denied for a particular process. By default, all system calls are allowed, but you can create a whitelist or blacklist of allowed or denied calls.

- b. Fine-Grained Control: Seccomp policies provide fine-grained control over system calls. This means you can specify which specific system calls are allowed or denied, rather than applying a broad filter to all calls. This fine-grained control minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of exploitation.

4. selinux - protect processes from eachother and host machine from running its processes

explain architecture of kubernetes?

MASTER NODE:
what is apiserver? - entrypoint
what is etcd? - database
Is etcd a service or a pod?
can we use etcd from outside the cluster?
what is schedular?what are the algorithms used by schedular?
what is filtering and scoring?
what is controller?


WORKER NODE:
what is Kubelet?
what is kube-proxy?
what is container-runtime?
what is container engine?


limitations of container gave birth to kubernetes
what is reuirement of enterprise?
- easy communication between large number of services 
- resource limits of applicationresources regardless of how many containers are running them.
- respond to application usage spikes to increase or decrease running containers.
- to react to service detirioration by running health checks
- gradual roll out of newrelease to a set of users
